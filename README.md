## ⚔️ Experience

Former **Principal Architect of Synthetically Guided Codebase Migration**, where I led the great SAS-to-Python Reformation through fire, brimstone, and Databricks cluster incantations. Adept at **ritualistic DevOps streamlining**, invoking YAML scrolls and Dockerized grimoires. Once performed industrial surveillance magic (🪄 security guard) and assisted in sacred inventory redistribution ceremonies (🛒 Netto).

Trained in the algorithmic monasteries of DIKU, with double exposure to **tensor rites**, **diffusion alchemy**, and advanced **data witchcraft**. My bachelor's thesis generated *literal exploding stars* (don’t fact-check that), and my master's thesis might or might not summon the AI singularity.

## 📚 Currently Learning

- Predictive disappointment modeling (CI/CD edition)  
- The sacred art of `git push --force && pray`  
- Kubernetes (but for real this time, I swear)  
- Analytical analysis of analytical analyses  
- Hacking the visual cortex with stable diffusion  
- Rats 🐀 (just... rats)

## 🔥 Fullstack, Misunderstood

I’m a *fullstack developer* in the loosest, most chaotic sense:
- C# for frontend (yes, **frontend**)  
- React as a stateless middleware gateway  
- FastAPI as a CSS preprocessor  
- SQL embedded in HTML because “it just works™”  
- Bash for business logic  
- JavaScript only when TypeScript cries itself to sleep

## 🐧 If GitHub Copilot achieves sentience...

I will sacrifice my Arch install and dual-boot into NixOS through sheer guilt and peer pressure.
